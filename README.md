#   Algorithms

##  Purpose of the projects

The code snippets are used as an exercise for xCS50 course

##  Description of the projects

This project is a collection of C programs designed to demonstrate various algorithms and programming concepts. 

1. **[max]()** - Implements a program to find the maximum value in an array using a linear search algorithm.
2. **[recursive]()** - Contains a recursive function that processes input data until a base case is reached.
3. **[snack]()** - Implements a linear search algorithm to find a specific item in a dataset.
4. **[temps]()** -  Sorts cities by average temperatures using bubble sort. Defines a structure for city names and temperatures, sorts in descending order, and prints the list. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient for small datasets.
