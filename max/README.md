# Max

## About Max

Implements A CS program to use linear search algorithm
to find the max value.

Linear search Algorithm was used to find the candidate which had the highest number.

Even if Linear Search Algorithm has a BC at log O(n) and the element could be hidden in the last index,

its well suited for small datasets, and doesnt require additional memory as the content doesn't need to be sorted.
